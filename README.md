# Poplar

Poplar is a platform for founding and managing Network Towns - digital communities with their own local economies. Our mission is to enable the creation of self-sustaining digital communities that own their economy through decentralized governance and token-based microeconomies.

## What are Network Towns?

Network Towns are digital communities that combine:
- **Community DAOs**: Decentralized governance structures for local decision-making and resource allocation
- **Local Economies**: Token-based microeconomies that support sustainable local development and commerce
- **Digital Infrastructure**: Web3 tools and platforms for managing decentralized town resources and services

## Features
