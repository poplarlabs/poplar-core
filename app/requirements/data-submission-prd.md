# Data Submission Module PRD

## Overview
The Data Submission Module enables users with connected wallets to submit and verify property records on the blockchain while ensuring data integrity through decentralized storage and on-chain verification. The module includes a staking mechanism using ROOT tokens to incentivize accurate data submission.

## Core Features

### 1. Wallet Connection
- Users must connect their Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the system
- Display wallet address and ROOT token balance
- Handle wallet connection/disconnection states

### 2. Property Record Submission
Required Fields:
- State (validated against standard US state list)
- County
- Parcel Number (format validation based on state/county standards)
- Property Address
  - Street Address
  - City
  - State
  - ZIP Code

### 3. Blockchain Integration
- Smart contract interaction for:
  - Data verification transaction
  - Storage of property record hash
  - ROOT token staking mechanism
- Gas fee estimation and confirmation
- Transaction status tracking and confirmation

### 4. Decentralized Storage
- Store complete property records in IPFS
- Generate and verify content hashes
- Maintain mapping between on-chain hashes and IPFS content
- Implement redundancy and availability measures

### 5. Staking Mechanism
- Required ROOT token stake per submission
- Stake amount: TBD based on economic model
- Stake locking period: TBD
- Slashing conditions for incorrect data
- Stake return mechanism for validated data

### 6. Property Record Viewer
- List view of all submitted properties
- Filtering capabilities:
  - By location (State/County)
  - By submission date
  - By wallet address (submitter)
- Detailed view for each property showing:
  - Property details
  - Submission metadata
  - Blockchain transaction info
  - Stake status

## Technical Requirements

### Smart Contracts
1. PropertyRecord Contract

   - Stake management
   - Hash verification
   - Record retrieval

2. Staking Contract
   - ROOT token integration
   - Stake/unstake functions
   - Slashing mechanism
   - Reward distribution

### Frontend Components

2. Property Submission Form
3. Transaction Status Monitor
4. Property Record Explorer
5. Staking Interface

### Backend Services
1. IPFS Integration
2. Blockchain Event Listener
3. Data Validation Service
4. API Gateway

## User Flow

1. Connect Wallet
   - User connects Web3 wallet
   - System verifies ROOT token balance

2. Submit Property Record
   - User fills submission form
   - System validates input
   - User approves ROOT token stake
   - System uploads to IPFS
   - Smart contract records hash
   - Transaction confirmation

3. View Properties
   - User accesses property explorer
   - System loads verified records
   - User can filter and view details

## Security Considerations

1. Smart Contract Security
   - Access control
   - Input validation
   - Reentrancy protection
   - Emergency pause functionality

2. Data Privacy
   - PII handling
   - Access control for sensitive data
   - Encryption standards

3. Staking Security
   - Stake locking mechanism
   - Slashing protection
   - Oracle integration for verification

## Performance Requirements

1. Transaction Speed
   - Maximum submission processing time: 30 seconds
   - Property list loading time: < 3 seconds

2. Scalability
   - Support for multiple concurrent submissions
   - Efficient IPFS content addressing
   - Optimized smart contract interactions

## Future Considerations

1. Enhanced Data Fields
   - Property characteristics
   - Historical records
   - Document attachments

2. Advanced Staking Features
   - Stake delegation
   - Automated verification
   - Reputation system

3. Integration Capabilities
   - Third-party data providers
   - Public records systems
   - Real estate platforms

## Success Metrics

1. Technical Metrics
   - Successful submission rate
   - Average transaction time
   - System uptime
   - Error rate

2. User Metrics
   - Number of active submitters
   - Total properties recorded
   - Stake participation rate
   - User satisfaction score
