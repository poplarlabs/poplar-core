# Risk Assessment & Testing Plan

This document outlines the biggest risks identified and a minimal testing strategy to validate key assumptions without building the full system.

## 1. Broad Property Records
**Risk:**
- The challenge is acquiring comprehensive and accurate property records from various sources.

**Test Plan:**
- Develop a minimal service to interface with property data sources (via APIs or web scraping).
- Validate the completeness, consistency, and quality of the retrieved data.

## 2. Tokenomics
**Risk:**
- While crowd-sourced record collection can be effective with the right token incentives, there is a critical risk that record consumers may not trust the system if the economic guarantees are insufficient.
- Additionally, it is uncertain whether consumers will be willing to pay for the validation of records, potentially undermining the system's ability to enforce accurate validations.
- There is also concern about the protocol's capability to provide umbrella insurance for validations, which might be essential for building trust.

**Test Plan:**
- Develop a smart contract prototype or simulation on a test network that not only tests token minting, transfers, and fees, but also incorporates mechanisms for incentivizing contributors and ensuring consumer trust.
- Conduct economic simulations and gather stakeholder feedback to validate if the incentives for record contributors and validators align with market expectations.
- Explore and test models for integrating a protocol-based insurance mechanism, evaluating the economic feasibility of such an approach in enhancing system trust.

## 3. Community Education and Engagement
**Risk:**
- There is a significant risk that validators and record consumers might not fully understand the system's underlying mechanisms and benefits, potentially hindering trust, adoption, and community growth.

**Test Plan:**
- Develop comprehensive educational materials including detailed documentation, interactive tutorials, and explainer videos that highlight the system's properties and economic models.
- Organize webinars, workshops, and community events to directly engage with validators and record consumers.
- Create incentive programs for community ambassadors and early adopters to promote system understanding and foster community building.
- Collect and analyze feedback from these initiatives to continuously refine the educational approach.

## Testing Order
1. Prototype and test the integration for Broad Property Records.
2. Validate the Tokenomics model with a minimal economic simulation.
3. Evaluate the educational outreach strategy and build initial community engagement efforts.

This phased approach allows us to address the most critical risks first, gaining early insights and iterating as necessary before scaling the full system.
