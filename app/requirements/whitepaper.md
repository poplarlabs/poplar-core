# Poplar: A Decentralized Protocol for Property Records on Base

## Abstract
Poplar is a Web3 protocol and application designed to revolutionize property record management by leveraging blockchain technology. Built on **Base**, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, Poplar enables the secure, transparent, and immutable tracking of property titles, ownership, and detailed property information. Using the **Poplar Root Token (ROOT)**, contributors submit data by staking tokens, and validation is triggered on-demand when users pay a fee, with rewards distributed to those providing or updating valid data over a decaying time period. This proof of stake (PoS) system ensures community-driven consensus, slashing stakes for incorrect submissions to deter fraud. Poplar eliminates inefficiencies, reduces manipulation risks, and fosters trust in real estate ecosystems.

## Introduction
Property records—titles, ownership histories, and property details—are foundational to real estate markets worldwide. Traditionally managed by centralized authorities, these records suffer from inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and vulnerability to errors or fraud. Poplar addresses these challenges by deploying a decentralized blockchain solution on **Base**, combining Ethereum’s security with scalable, low-cost transactions. Named after the resilient and interconnected poplar tree, Poplar reflects a stable, community-driven foundation for property data management. This whitepaper outlines the protocol’s architecture, token economics, anti-fraud mechanisms, technical implementation, and a detailed analysis of its strengths and risks.

## Protocol Architecture

### Overview
Poplar operates as a decentralized platform where contributors submit property data with a ROOT stake, users trigger validation by paying a fee when they need the data, and ROOT holders vote on accuracy via a PoS system. Rewards are distributed to contributors of valid data with a time-decay factor, and stakes are slashed for non-consensus submissions. The Poplar Root Token (ROOT) drives the incentive system, rewarding accuracy and penalizing fraud.

### 1. Data Submission
- **Contributors**: Individuals or entities (e.g., property owners, surveyors) submit property data—such as ownership deeds, titles, or physical characteristics—by staking ROOT tokens. The stake acts as a security deposit to deter frivolous or fraudulent submissions.
- **Data Types**: Includes ownership records, liens, property boundaries, square footage, and historical transactions.
- **Storage**: Submitted data is recorded on-chain with a timestamp and submission ID, forming a version history, but remains unvalidated until requested.

### 2. On-Demand Validation
- **Trigger**: When a user (data consumer) needs to use a specific submission (e.g., the latest version), they pay a validation fee in ROOT, choosing the amount based on the data’s importance (e.g., higher for real estate sales, lower for casual queries). The user can submit a validation for a property that has not had data recorded yet to trigger an initial data request.
- **Voting Process**: The fee triggers a voting period (e.g., 48 hours) where ROOT holders stake tokens to vote “yes” (data is correct) or “no” (data is incorrect). Votes are weighted by stake, and the outcome is determined by majority stake (e.g., 66% threshold).
- **Outcome**:
  - **Valid Data**: If “yes” wins, the data is marked as validated, and the fee is distributed (see below).
  - **Invalid Data**: If “no” wins, the contributor’s stake is slashed, and the fee is either returned to the user or distributed to “no” voters.

### 3. Reward Distribution
- **Valid Data Rewards**: If validated, the fee is split:
  - **Contributor**: 50% goes to the data provider, adjusted by a decay factor based on time since submission (e.g., `reward = fee * (1 - (time_since_submission / 365 days))`, capped at 0).
  - **Voters**: 40% is distributed to “yes” voters, proportional to their stake.
  - **Treasury**: 10% funds protocol development and sustainability.
- **Invalid Data**: The contributor’s stake is slashed (e.g., 100% loss), and the fee may be redistributed to “no” voters or refunded to the user.

### 4. Data Access
- **Users**: Anyone can view unvalidated data for free, but validated data requires a fee payment to trigger or access prior validation.
- **Fee Flexibility**: Users set fees based on need, ensuring cost aligns with value.

## Anti-Fraud Mechanisms
Preventing fraudulent data changes is central to Poplar. The following mechanisms ensure data integrity:

1. **Staking and Slashing**  
   Contributors stake ROOT when submitting data. If the data fails validation, their stake is slashed, deterring fraud.

2. **On-Demand PoS Voting**  
   Validation occurs only when needed, with ROOT holders voting based on stake. Manipulating outcomes requires controlling a majority of staked ROOT, which is costly and difficult.

3. **Challenge Mechanism**  
   After validation, users can challenge data by staking ROOT and providing evidence. A new voting round assesses the challenge:
   - Successful challenges correct the data, slash the original contributor’s stake, and reward the challenger.
   - Failed challenges result in the challenger losing their stake.

4. **Immutable Historical Record**  
   Base’s blockchain records all submissions and validations with timestamps, enabling audits and dispute resolution.

5. **Initial Onboarding Standards**  
   Initial property entries require certified documents, establishing a reliable baseline.

These layers combine economic penalties, community oversight, and transparency to make fraud impractical.

## Token Economics
The **Poplar Root Token (ROOT)** powers the ecosystem:

- **Supply**: Fixed initial supply, adjustable via governance votes by ROOT holders.
- **Utility**:
  - **Staking**: Required for submitting data, voting, and challenging records.
  - **Rewards**: Paid to contributors and voters for valid data, with decay for contributors.
  - **Access Fees**: Paid by users to trigger validation, redistributed to participants.
  - **Governance**: ROOT holders vote on protocol upgrades.
- **Sustainability**: 10% of fees fund a treasury, with potential token burns to manage supply.

## Strengths and Risks of the Protocol Design

### Validation System
- **Strengths**:
  - **On-Demand Efficiency**: Validation occurs only when needed, reducing unnecessary costs and aligning effort with user demand.
  - **Community Consensus**: PoS voting ensures broad participation, with higher fees attracting more voters for critical data, enhancing accuracy.
  - **Flexibility**: Users control validation depth via fee size, balancing cost and reliability.
- **Risks**:
  - **Lazy Validation**: Unvalidated data may be used if no one pays, risking errors. Mitigation: Require validation for high-stakes actions or flag unverified data.
  - **Low Voter Turnout**: Small fees might attract few voters, risking manipulation. Mitigation: Set minimum fees or scale voting periods with fee size.

### Incentive System
- **Strengths**:
  - **Accuracy Incentive**: Contributors are rewarded for valid, recent data and penalized for errors, encouraging quality submissions.
  - **Voter Participation**: Fee shares motivate voters to engage, especially for high-fee validations, ensuring robust consensus.
  - **Time Decay**: Rewards favor recent updates, keeping data current and relevant.
- **Risks**:
  - **Old Data Neglect**: Decay might discourage validation of historical data, leaving gaps. Mitigation: Offer premium fees for validating older records.
  - **Spam Submissions**: Providers might flood the system with versions, though staking and slashing deter this. Mitigation: Limit submission frequency.

### Tokenomics System
- **Strengths**:
  - **Balanced Incentives**: Providers seek rewards, voters earn from participation, users pay for value, and the treasury ensures sustainability.
  - **Economic Deterrence**: Stake slashing aligns provider interests with accuracy, reducing fraud.
  - **Governance Empowerment**: ROOT holders shape the protocol, fostering community ownership.
- **Risks**:
  - **Fee Misalignment**: If fees are too low, rewards may not attract enough voters or providers. Mitigation: Adjust fee structures via governance.
  - **Decay Overreach**: Excessive decay could undervalue valid older data. Mitigation: Use a transparent, adjustable decay formula (e.g., linear or exponential).

Overall, the system produces valid, consistent data by tying validation to user needs, incentivizing accuracy through rewards and penalties, and leveraging community consensus via PoS. Risks are manageable with careful parameter tuning and governance.
